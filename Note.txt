what and why React Query

1- React Query:A library for fetching data in a react application
2- React is a UI library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.
3- useEffect hook for data fetching and useState hook to maintain component state like loading, error, or resulting data.
4- if the data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries.
5- Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client site. 
6- state management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state.
/////////////////
server state is very different of client state.
1- Client state:
    Persisted in your app memory and accessing or updating it is synchronous.
2- Server state
    1- Persisted remotely and requires asynchronous APIs for fetching or updating    
    2- Has shared ownership.
    3- data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge.
    4- UI data may not be in sync the remote data.
challenging when you have to deal with caching, deduping multiple requests for the same data, updating stale data in background, performance optimizations etc
